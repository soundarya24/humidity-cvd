### Humdity

#### Objective 1: Exposureâ€“Response Estimates (IRRs)

-   IRRs for CVD DALY, YLD, and YLL now available as cleaned tables.

#### Objective 2: 2021 Economic Burden Estimation

-   Total CVD DALYs attributable to high average humidity calculated for 2021.
-   Visualized as Indian maps, bar charts, and absolute-value tables.
-   Multiplied DALYs with cost per DALY (CpD_2021) to estimate total economic burden.
-   Results available as clean bar charts and aggregated national summary (â‚¹5,303,262,176).

#### Objective 3: 2030 Projections

-   Projected CVD DALYs attributable to high average humidity for 2030 using ARIMA.
-   Projected CpD_2030 using compound growth rate from 2021.
-   Estimated total economic burden for 2030 now available via bar charts and tables (â‚¹7,763,493,377).
-   Represents a **46.4% increase** in burden from 2021 to 2030.

### Temperature

#### Objective 1: Exposureâ€“Response Estimates (IRRs)

-   IRRs for CVD DALY, YLD, and YLL now available as cleaned tables.

#### Objective 2: 2021 Economic Burden Estimation

-   Total CVD DALYs attributable to high average temperature calculated for 2021.
-   Visualized as Indian maps, bar charts, and absolute-value tables.
-   Multiplied DALYs with cost per DALY (CpD_2021) to estimate total economic burden.
-   Results available as clean bar charts and aggregated national summary (â‚¹42,947,335,297).

#### Objective 3: 2030 Projections

-   Projected CVD DALYs attributable to high average temperature for 2030 using ARIMA.
-   Projected CpD_2030 using compound growth rate from 2021.
-   Estimated total economic burden for 2030 now available via bar charts and tables (â‚¹62,109,927,686).
-   Represents a **44.6% increase** in burden from 2021 to 2030.
